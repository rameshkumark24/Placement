Sure, I’ll explain my project.

I developed a full-stack Library Management System designed to manage books, members, and borrowing operations efficiently.

The system follows a layered architecture, where the frontend is built using React.js, and the backend is developed using Java with Spring Boot. The backend exposes REST APIs, which handle business logic and interact with a MySQL database using JPA and Hibernate.

From an implementation perspective, I designed APIs for managing books, users, and issue-return workflows, ensuring proper separation between controller, service, and repository layers.

I also implemented global exception handling, so instead of system failures, the application returns structured error responses, improving reliability.

On the frontend side, I built a responsive dashboard and handled API communication using Axios, including proper error handling to ensure a smooth user experience even during failures.

During development, I faced challenges like deployment issues, CORS errors, and frontend crashes due to invalid API responses. I resolved them by configuring proper routing, implementing defensive programming, and setting up secure backend configurations.

Overall, this project helped me understand how to design and build a scalable, end-to-end application while handling real-world issues in deployment and system integration.

🔁 FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS (VERY IMPORTANT)

These are almost guaranteed.

🔴 Q1: “Explain your architecture in detail”
✅ Answer:

The system follows a layered architecture:
Controller handles incoming requests, Service contains business logic, and Repository interacts with the database.

This separation ensures maintainability, scalability, and easier debugging.

🔴 Q2: “How did you design your database?”
✅ Answer:

I designed tables for books, members, and borrow records.
Relationships were handled using JPA annotations like OneToMany and ManyToOne to maintain proper data mapping.

🔴 Q3: “What challenges did you face?”
✅ Answer (VERY IMPORTANT):

One major challenge was handling frontend crashes when the backend failed.
I solved it using defensive programming by validating API responses before processing them.

Another challenge was CORS issues during deployment, which I fixed by configuring allowed origins in the backend.

🔴 Q4: “What is global exception handling?”
✅ Answer:

Instead of handling exceptions in every controller, I created a centralized exception handler using Spring Boot.
This ensures all errors are handled uniformly and returned as structured responses.

🔴 Q5: “Why did you use JPA instead of raw SQL?”
✅ Answer:

JPA allows us to interact with the database using objects, reducing boilerplate code and improving maintainability.
It also helps prevent issues like SQL injection.

🔴 Q6: “What happens when backend is down?”
✅ Answer:

Initially, the frontend crashed, but I fixed it by adding checks to validate responses and show fallback UI instead of breaking the application.

🔴 Q7: “How would you improve this project?”
✅ Answer (VERY HIGH IMPACT):

I would improve it by adding caching for better performance, implementing microservices architecture for scalability, and adding role-based authentication for better security.
